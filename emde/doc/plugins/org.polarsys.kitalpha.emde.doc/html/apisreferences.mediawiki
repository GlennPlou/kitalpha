== Adding programmatically extensions to an extensible element ==

Any extensible element has the reference <code>'''ownedExtensions'''</code>. It is defined in the ExtensibleElement EClass and inherited by all class declared as extensible.

To add programmatically an extension to an extensible element, the reference <code>'''ownedExtensions'''</code> must be updated by adding the extension element to it.
