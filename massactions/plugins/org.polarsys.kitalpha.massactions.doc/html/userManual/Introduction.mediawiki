The Mass Editing and Mass Visualization tools are designed to increase your productivity when editing and visualizing EObject elements.

== Mass Editing ==
The Mass Editing tool allows users to edit multiple (homogenous) objects simultaneously. These objects are selected from a table and have all of their changeable features in common, such as Name, ID or Description.

By aggregating all the values of each of these features, users can quickly choose to either keep or overwrite them.

== Mass Visualization ==
The mass Visualization tool allows users to visualize the common aspects of numerous (homogenous) objects. 

By grouping the objects according to their attributes, properties and relationships with other existing objects and filtering the result according to their custom patterns, users have a comprehensive overview over the target of their analysis.
