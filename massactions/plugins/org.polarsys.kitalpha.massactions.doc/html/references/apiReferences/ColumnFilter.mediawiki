=Column Filter=

==Introduction==
The column filter extension point allows to contribute to the
existing default column filters. You should use this extension point if among the common columns only a handful are relevant for your use. You can therefore choose to hide some of them.  

Note that the hidden columns can always be enabled by the user, since they are only visually hidden (but continue to exist in memory).

The interface associated to this extension point is <code>IMAColumnFilter</code>, but you should avoid implementing this interface directly and instead extend the <code>AbstractMAColumnFilter</code> class.

The only method you need to implement is the <code>test</code> method, which specifies if the current column should be hidden or not.
